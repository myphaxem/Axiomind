# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing the core system and CLI components of the Axiomind Heads-Up No-Limit Hold'em poker system. The system consists of a Rust-based game engine that handles poker rules, state transitions, and hand evaluation, along with a comprehensive CLI interface for playing, simulating, and analyzing poker games.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Game Engine

**User Story:** As a poker researcher, I want a reliable game engine that enforces Texas Hold'em rules, so that I can conduct accurate simulations and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new game is started THEN the system SHALL initialize two players with 20000 chips each
2. WHEN dealing cards THEN the system SHALL use proper shuffling and burning procedures according to Texas Hold'em rules
3. WHEN processing player actions THEN the system SHALL validate all bets and raises according to no-limit rules
4. WHEN determining winners THEN the system SHALL correctly evaluate poker hands and distribute pots
5. IF a player's stack reaches 0 THEN the system SHALL end the game
6. WHEN using a seed value THEN the system SHALL produce deterministic, reproducible results

### Requirement 2: Hand History Logging

**User Story:** As a poker analyst, I want detailed hand histories saved in a structured format, so that I can analyze gameplay patterns and results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each hand completes THEN the system SHALL append a complete hand record to JSONL format
2. WHEN logging hand data THEN the system SHALL include all player actions, board cards, and final results
3. WHEN saving hand records THEN the system SHALL use UTF-8 encoding with LF line endings
4. WHEN generating hand IDs THEN the system SHALL create unique identifiers in format "YYYYMMDD-NNNNNN"
5. IF a seed is used THEN the system SHALL record the seed value in the hand history

### Requirement 3: CLI Interface for Game Play

**User Story:** As a user, I want to play poker games through a command-line interface, so that I can practice and test different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `axm play --vs human` THEN the system SHALL start an interactive game against human input
2. WHEN running `axm play --vs ai` THEN the system SHALL start a game against AI opponent
3. WHEN specifying `--hands N` THEN the system SHALL play exactly N hands before stopping
4. WHEN specifying `--level L` THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate blind structure for level L
5. WHEN specifying `--seed VALUE` THEN the system SHALL use the provided seed for reproducible games

### Requirement 4: CLI Interface for Analysis

**User Story:** As a poker researcher, I want CLI tools to analyze hand histories and verify system integrity, so that I can ensure data quality and extract insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `axm replay --input PATH` THEN the system SHALL replay hands from the specified file
2. WHEN running `axm stats --input PATH` THEN the system SHALL generate statistical summaries from hand data
3. WHEN running `axm verify` THEN the system SHALL check rule compliance and conservation laws
4. WHEN running `axm deal` THEN the system SHALL deal and display a single hand for inspection
5. WHEN running `axm bench` THEN the system SHALL run performance benchmarks on core functions

### Requirement 5: CLI Interface for Simulation

**User Story:** As a poker researcher, I want to run large-scale simulations, so that I can gather statistical data on different strategies and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `axm sim --hands N` THEN the system SHALL simulate N hands without user interaction
2. WHEN running `axm eval --ai-a NAME --ai-b NAME` THEN the system SHALL evaluate two AI strategies against each other
3. WHEN specifying simulation parameters THEN the system SHALL respect all seed, level, and AI configuration options
4. WHEN simulations complete THEN the system SHALL output results to appropriate data files
5. IF simulation is interrupted THEN the system SHALL save partial results gracefully

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configuration management and diagnostic tools, so that I can ensure the system is properly set up and functioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `axm cfg` THEN the system SHALL display current default settings
2. WHEN running `axm doctor` THEN the system SHALL check system environment and report any issues
3. WHEN running `axm rng` THEN the system SHALL verify random number generation quality
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate and apply them correctly
5. IF diagnostic issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions

### Requirement 7: Data Export and Management

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to export and transform poker data into different formats, so that I can use external tools for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `axm export` THEN the system SHALL convert hand histories to specified formats
2. WHEN running `axm dataset` THEN the system SHALL create training datasets with proper splits
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and completeness
4. WHEN creating datasets THEN the system SHALL support random and stratified sampling methods
5. IF export operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and preserve original data
