# Requirements Document

## Introduction

このドキュメントは、Axiomind Heads-Up No-Limit Hold'em システムのrust/webコンポーネントの要件を定義します。このコンポーネントは、ローカルHTTPサーバーとして動作し、HTML UIとhtmxを使用してインタラクティブなポーカーゲーム体験を提供します。engineのイベントを購読し、Server-Sent Events (SSE)を通じてリアルタイムでUIを更新します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: HTTP サーバー基盤

**User Story:** As a poker player, I want to access the poker game through a web browser, so that I can play with a modern, interactive interface.

1. WHEN the web server is started THEN the system SHALL bind to a configurable port (default 8080)
2. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets efficiently
3. WHEN handling HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL support GET and POST methods for game interactions
4. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL log the server address and port for user reference
5. IF the port is already in use THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 2: Game Session Management

**User Story:** As a poker player, I want to start and manage game sessions through the web interface, so that I can control my gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the root URL THEN the system SHALL display a game lobby with session creation options
2. WHEN creating a new session THEN the system SHALL initialize a game engine instance with specified parameters
3. WHEN specifying game parameters THEN the system SHALL support seed, level, and opponent type configuration
4. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain game state and handle player actions
5. IF multiple sessions are requested THEN the system SHALL manage them independently

### Requirement 3: Real-time Game Updates via SSE

**User Story:** As a poker player, I want to see game updates in real-time, so that I can follow the action as it happens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client connects to the SSE endpoint THEN the system SHALL establish a persistent connection
2. WHEN game events occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to connected clients immediately
3. WHEN sending game state THEN the system SHALL include player stacks, board cards, and current action
4. WHEN a hand completes THEN the system SHALL send complete hand results including showdown information
5. IF the SSE connection is lost THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully

### Requirement 4: Interactive Game Controls

**User Story:** As a poker player, I want to make betting decisions through the web interface, so that I can play the game interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's the player's turn THEN the system SHALL display available actions (fold, call, raise, all-in)
2. WHEN making a bet or raise THEN the system SHALL provide input validation and amount selection
3. WHEN submitting an action THEN the system SHALL process it through the game engine and update state
4. WHEN displaying betting options THEN the system SHALL show minimum and maximum bet amounts
5. IF an invalid action is submitted THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 5: Game State Visualization

**User Story:** As a poker player, I want to see the current game state clearly, so that I can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the game table THEN the system SHALL show player positions, stacks, and hole cards
2. WHEN community cards are dealt THEN the system SHALL display them prominently on the board
3. WHEN showing pot information THEN the system SHALL display current pot size and betting action
4. WHEN a hand is in progress THEN the system SHALL highlight the active player and available actions
5. WHEN hands complete THEN the system SHALL show winning hands and chip distribution

### Requirement 6: Hand History and Statistics

**User Story:** As a poker analyst, I want to view hand histories and statistics through the web interface, so that I can analyze gameplay without using CLI tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the history page THEN the system SHALL display recent hands with key information
2. WHEN viewing hand details THEN the system SHALL show complete action sequences and results
3. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL show win rates, average pot sizes, and hand counts
4. WHEN filtering history THEN the system SHALL support date ranges and result types
5. IF no hands are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Settings

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure game settings through the web interface, so that I can customize my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL display configurable options for game parameters
2. WHEN changing blind levels THEN the system SHALL update the game engine configuration
3. WHEN setting AI difficulty THEN the system SHALL apply changes to opponent behavior
4. WHEN saving settings THEN the system SHALL persist them for future sessions
5. IF invalid settings are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and show error messages

### Requirement 8: Engine Integration and Event Handling

**User Story:** As a system component, I want to integrate seamlessly with the game engine, so that game logic remains consistent across interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the web server THEN the system SHALL create and configure game engine instances
2. WHEN processing player actions THEN the system SHALL delegate all game logic to the engine
3. WHEN engine events are emitted THEN the system SHALL capture and transform them for web clients
4. WHEN hand records are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure they match CLI output format
5. IF engine errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 9: Static Asset Management

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want efficient static asset serving, so that the UI loads quickly and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving HTML files THEN the system SHALL include proper MIME types and caching headers
2. WHEN serving CSS and JavaScript THEN the system SHALL support modern web standards
3. WHEN loading htmx library THEN the system SHALL serve it efficiently or reference CDN
4. WHEN serving card images THEN the system SHALL optimize for fast loading and display
5. IF assets are missing THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 404 responses

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate status codes and error pages
2. WHEN game errors happen THEN the system SHALL log them with sufficient detail for debugging
3. WHEN clients disconnect unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL clean up resources properly
4. WHEN the server shuts down THEN the system SHALL gracefully close all connections
